# Synaptic Plasticity Modeling and Fitting Toolkit

**Author:** Maria Reva  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Language:** Python 3.8+

## üìñ Overview

This toolkit implements a biologically inspired model of short-term synaptic plasticity, specifically paired-pulse interactions in inhibitory synapses under control and dopaminergic manipulation (e.g., quinpirole application).

It fits model parameters to experimental recordings using optimization techniques and visualizes key outputs (IPSC, calcium, release probability, etc.).

## üß† Biological Context

The model simulates:
- Calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release probability
- Effects of D2 receptor agonists (like quinpirole) on synaptic behavior

Data sources include paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and IPSC amplitude measurements from different experimental conditions and stiratal regions.
